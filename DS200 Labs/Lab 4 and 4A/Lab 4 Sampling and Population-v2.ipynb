I also wish to thank Dr. Matthew Beckman (in Department of Statistics) for contributing to the revision of the lab for the purpose of its use in DS 200.\n\nWe will introduce the important two important concepts in statistics: sampling and randomness [randomness](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/09/Randomness.html).\n\nThe data used in this lab will contain salary data and other statistics for basketball players from the 2014-2015 NBA season. This data was collected from the following sports analytic sites: [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com) and [Spotrac](http://www.spotrac.com).\n\nFirst, install the datascience module by running the cell below, which will take some time. Wait untill the installation process completes."

      "source": "Rather than getting data on every player, imagine that we had gotten data on only a smaller subset of the players.  For 492 players, it's not so unreasonable to expect to see all the data, but usually we aren't so lucky.  Instead, we often make statistical inferences about a large underlying population using a smaller sample.\n\n### Using a Sample to Estimate the Population\n\nA *statistical inference* is a statement about some statistic of the underlying population, such as \"the average salary of NBA players in 2014 was $3\".  You may have heard the word \"inference\" used in other contexts.  It's important to keep in mind that statistical inferences, unlike, say, logical inferences, can be wrong.\n\nA general strategy for inference using samples is to estimate statistics of the population by computing the same statistics on a sample.  This strategy sometimes works well and sometimes doesn't.  The degree to which it gives us useful answers depends on several factors, and we'll touch lightly on a few of those today.\n\nOne very important factor in the utility of samples is how they were gathered.  We have prepared some example sample datasets to simulate inference from different kinds of samples for the NBA player dataset.  Later we'll ask you to create your own samples to see how they behave."

For example, you might choose players from one team who are near your house, since it's easier to survey them.  This is called, somewhat pejoratively, *convenience sampling*.\n\nSuppose you survey only *relatively new* players with ages less than 22.  (The more experienced players didn't bother to answer your surveys about their salaries.)\n\n### Exercise 1.\nAssign `convenience_sample` to a subset of `full_data` that contains only the rows for players under the age of 22.\n#### Hint: where(\"Age\", are.above(...)) or where(\"Age\", are.below(..)) can be useful here."

The sample median salary and histogram is still different than the entire population median salary and histogram but not as much compared to the size 44 sample median salary and histogram. The relationship is that the larger the sample size, the less the sample will deviate from the actual median. *"
