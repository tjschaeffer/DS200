For example, we will later use sklearn module to create decision tree models from a set of labelled data.  \n### Because the datascience module is not pre-installed in Azure Jupyter Notebook,  we need to use the following command to install it in the beginning of every Azure notebook that needs to use it.\n### Complete \"!pip install datascience\" in the line below.  Then click the \"Run\" button (under the \"Cell\" menu item on the top row of this web page)"

A table can be viewed in two ways:\n* A sequence of named columns that each describe a single aspect of all entries in a data set\n* A sequence of rows that each contain all information about a single entry in a data set\n\nEach column of this table data structure must contain values of the same kind. For example, a table can have a column of integers or a column of strings. We can create a table from scratch or from a CSV file. Let's try reading a CSV file into a table.\n\nIn the Python code below, we use Table.read_table to read a CSV file called \"SFSalaries2011_2014.csv\".\n\n- Note 1: We use a pair of double quotes \".....\" to indicate a string in Python.  Otherwise, Python may interpret it as a variable name (like salaries).\n- Note 2: Table.read_table is like a function.  It takes a file name as input, and returns a Table object as its output.\n- Note 3: We can use assignment (=) in Python to assign the output of the function Table.read_table to a variable (like salaries)\n- Note 4: Running a line that contains only a variable results in displaying the content of the variable.\n\n### Exercise 1 Read and display a salary dataset using Table."

If you're proficient in a natural language, you can understand a non-proficient speaker, glossing over small mistakes.

Names are given to values in Python using an **assignment statement**. In an assignment, a name is followed by =, which is followed by any expression.

      "source": "When using `sort`, the default sort order is ascending (from lowest salary to highest salary). Since we are interested in getting top salaries, it is more convenient to sort the table in DESCENDING order (from highest slary to lowest salary).  We can do this  using the `descending` argument of `sort` with the boolean value `True`, shown below and. The `descending` argument is optional and is set to `False` when its value is not specified as in the previous case. \n\nAdditional Note: In Python, whenever you see a function argument of the form `<argument name>=<argument value>`, the argument is optional and does not need to be passed in. Not passing in the argument will cause the default value (e.g., `False` is the default value of the `descending` argument) to be used.  \n\n### Exercise 5\nFill in the correct value for the descending parameter of salaries.sort so that the salary table can be sorted such that employees with highest TotalPay are on the top of the table."
