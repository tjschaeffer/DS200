In this lab, we are\nalso going to use CountVectorizer to convert a set of real tweets into a word frequency matrix representation.  We made two improvements to the way we convert text to word frequency matrix in Lab 3.\n- Because real tweets contain non-alphanumeric characters such as emojis, we use a regular expression to extract all alphanumeric words, hashtags, and Twitter users (i.e., @...) mentioned in a tweet, ignore the other non-alphanumeric characters.  You do not need to understand the details of how this regulare expression is constructed.  You just need\nto understand their function.\n- Because the number of tweets are large, we do not want to include any word that occurs only in ONE tweet (why?). \nTo do this, we use set \"minimum document frequency\" (min_df) to be 2.  \"Documents\" refers to, in this case, tweets."
